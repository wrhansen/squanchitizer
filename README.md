# Squanchitizer

Rick is trying to help his daughter Beth squanch better but he doesn't have enough time off from saving the galaxy to work on it so he's hired you. In no particular order,

Replace every verb in a supplied text with "squanch".
Create a site that a user can type text into and have the verbs changed to "squanch".
Highlight the verbs as the user types and replace them with "squanch" in real time when they type the sentence's period.
Allow the typer to save the document and create a user account.
Create a user dashboard listing a user's documents, when they were created, the number of squanches in them, and the ability to edit an individual document.
You have 2 hours. The choice of language(s) and implementation is yours. Deploy the website somewhere and email credentials so Rick can see your architecture decisions. Submit your code as a repo on your favorite repo hosting site. The universe depends on you.
